## Overview

This package contains the scripts required to build a custom PowerApps Component Framework (PCF) control for Microsoft PowerApps.
The scripts are designed to be used in conjunction with the Microsoft PowerApps CLI tool, which is separately available via an MSI installer.

Please visit the publicly available [documentation for the Microsoft PowerApps CLI tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/component-framework/create-custom-controls-using-pcf) to learn more.
You can also install the PowerApps CLI via its [MSI installer](https://aka.ms/PowerAppsCLI).

**Without Microsoft PowerApps CLI tool this package should only be used for reference purposes.**

## Release Notes:

1.0.6:
- Production builds that generate bundle sizes larger than 5 MB will result in a build failure
- Properties defined in ControlManifest.Input.xml must now define the 'usage' attribute

0.4.3:
- Added anonymous telemetry to pcf; to opt out use PowerApps CLI, see:
[PowerApps CLI telemetry](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/component-framework/get-powerapps-cli#microsoft-powerapps-cli-telemetry)
- Bug fixes:
  - Fix webpack build error when using TS path mappings based module resolution

0.3.4:
- Improved manifest validation for controls with datasets
- Fixed issue with preserving nested subfolder structure for control resources in the output folder

0.2.71:
- [React](https://reactjs.org) is no longer treated as an external library. Now tooling can bundle it directly with the custom component source code.
- When building, relative paths used in the manifest are now preserved when generating the control output folder. For example, if a resource file is located in a `control folder\css\subfolder`, this subfolder path will be created in the output folder during build.
- In support for future library sharing capabilities, we are removing the need for library definition in the ControlManifest.Input.xml. This will impact previously created components using library tag (please remove all libraries from the ControlManifest.Input.xml and replace them with an import statement in the index.ts).
- Control author can include a preview image by setting the `preview-image` attribute in manifest's `<control>` node.
- PCF UI is localized for: English, French, German, Japanese, Spanish

0.2.59:
- PCF build output enhancements include: 
    - Colorization
    - Timestamps
    - Formatting updates
    - PCF build now produces formal error codes in conjunction with error messages

0.1:
- Initial set of capabilities for custom control development using the PowerApps Component Framework (PCF).
