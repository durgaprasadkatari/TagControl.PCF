<img alt="gzipped size" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/gzipped-4.28kb-brightgreen.svg">

This package only includes React bindings for [Fela](http://github.com/rofrischmann/fela).<br>
It assumes you already know about Fela and how to use it.

## Installation
```sh
npm i --save react-fela
```

Assuming you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) as your package manager you can basically just `npm install` all packages. <br>
Otherwise we also provide [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) builds for each package within the `dist` folder. You can easily use them via [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/).
> **Caution**: You need to include both React and Fela on your own as well.
